0.3.5 - March 12th 2014
 * Script variables are now global - SOME SCRIPTS MAY BREAK DUE TO THIS!
   Scripting with global variables is somewhat different to having local ones, you have to

 * When ECHO'ing to a picture window, the text was silently ignored. fixed, the text displays in the
   status of previous connection.
 * The script editor does now keep some sort of trace of text cursor when changing between documents.
   However when saving the cursor still goes back to top.
 * Text cursor in subwindows should not be visible in all windows, only the active one.
   However the fix for this added another bug that makes the latest created window to lose it, but
   double clicking the text-input shows it back again.
 * Fixed when a socket was closed by the peer it wasn't destroyed causing the socket name to be unusable.
